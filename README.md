# trash_kitty_love
A game about trash and love affairs.

Find treasures in a trash bin. Wrong guess = you lose a life. Right answer = 10 points. See how much points you can score with only 9 lives!

Visit the roof to meet new kitties. Guess which treasure that kitty would like to get their number. If you find a wedding ring, you can either score 50 points or make a proposal to kitty of your choice from your phonebook.
